# StudentFeedbackSystem
 * In this app, there are three user categories - Student, Teacher, Admin.
 * Students and Teachers can register by entering their respective details and department info.
 * A student can submit course evalutaion feedbacks (based on 5 stars rating) for those teachers who are in his department. Obviously this is annonymous.
 * A teacher can see all the feedbacks submitted by students only for him which is shown by omitting the student info/ID (Annonymous) in a tabular view along with the average rating.
 * An admin can manage the whole users list and feedback data. Users and Feedbacks data can also be deleted by an Admin.

This app resembles to the existing TER survey functionality in IIUC Student Panel.
